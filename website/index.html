        <h1>What is climate change</h1>
        <img class="section2img" src="resources/images/afbeelding section2.jpg" alt="" width="25%" height="25%">
        <p>Climate change, driven predominantly by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, represents one of the most pressing global challenges of our time. It is fundamentally altering the Earth's climate system, resulting in rising global temperatures, more frequent and severe weather events, melting polar ice caps, and disruptions to ecosystems. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching, affecting not only the environment but also human societies. These impacts manifest in the form of extreme weather events, sea-level rise, food and water scarcity, and threats to biodiversity. Mitigating and adapting to climate change require international cooperation, transitioning to sustainable energy sources, and adopting more resilient and environmentally conscious practices to secure a sustainable future for our planet and its inhabitants.</p>
        <p>Human activity leads to change in the atmospheric composition either directly (via emissions of gases or particles) or indirectly (via atmospheric chemistry). Anthropogenic emissions have driven the changes in WMGHG concentrations during the Industrial Era. Radiative forcing (RF) is a measure of the net change in the energy balance of the Earth system in response to some external perturbation; positive RF leads to a warming and negative RF to a cooling. The RF concept is valuable for comparing the influence on global mean surface temperature of most individual agents affecting the Earthâ€™s radiation balance.</p>

                <h2>Smart Homes</h2>
                <p>Smart homes are revolutionizing the way we live by integrating cutting-edge technology into our daily routines. These innovative environments are equipped with interconnected devices and systems that can be controlled remotely or automatically to enhance convenience, security, and energy efficiency. From voice-activated virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa to smart thermostats and lighting systems that adapt to our preferences, smart homes offer a level of automation and customization that was once considered science fiction. With the ability to monitor and adjust various aspects of the home, such as temperature, lighting, security, and entertainment, smart homes not only provide increased comfort but also contribute to sustainability and peace of mind, making them an integral part of our increasingly connected world.</p>

                <h2>Smart farming</h2>
                <p>Smart farming, often referred to as precision agriculture, represents a transformative shift in the way we cultivate crops and raise livestock. This approach leverages a combination of technology, data, and automation to optimize farming practices and maximize productivity. Through the use of sensors, drones, GPS technology, and data analytics, farmers can monitor and manage their fields and livestock with unprecedented precision. This results in more efficient resource utilization, reduced environmental impact, and increased yields. Smart farming also enables predictive maintenance for equipment, helping to minimize downtime and reduce operational costs. With the world's population on the rise and the need for sustainable agriculture practices, smart farming is a vital solution that not only increases food production but also promotes environmental stewardship in the agricultural sector.</p>

                <h2>Smart cities</h2>
                <p>Smart cities are the future of urban living, harnessing technology to enhance the quality of life for their residents while promoting sustainability and efficiency. These urban hubs employ a range of digital solutions, from IoT sensors and data analytics to integrated transportation systems and renewable energy sources. By collecting and analyzing data on traffic flow, air quality, energy consumption, and more, smart cities can optimize resource allocation, reduce congestion, and minimize environmental impact. Additionally, these cities prioritize connectivity, offering residents access to high-speed internet and digital services that streamline daily activities, from public transportation to healthcare. As the world's population becomes increasingly urbanized, smart cities represent a crucial paradigm shift in urban planning, offering solutions to the challenges of modern urban life while paving the way for a more connected, eco-friendly, and prosperous future.</p>
